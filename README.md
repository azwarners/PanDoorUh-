Adding some functionality to Pandora.com that I feel is missing.

Live track skipper - Growing up listening to traditional over-the-air radio stations, the vast majority of songs that I heard on the radio were studio tracks. I love Pandora, but I'm frequently annoyed by the amount of obscure live tracks that they play. This extension aims to automatically thumb down live tracks.

That's it for now, but this project is still in its infancy. As soon as the bugs get worked out, I'll be adding more features.
