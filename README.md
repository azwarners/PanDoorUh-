# PanDoorUhPlusPlus
Adding some functionality to Pandora.com that I feel is missing.

Live track skipper - Growing up listening to traditional over-the-air radio stations, the vast majority of songs that I heard on the radio were studio tracks. I love Pandora, but I'm frequently annoyed by the amount of obscure live tracks that they play. This extension aims to automatically thumb down live tracks.

Artist blacklist - Everyone has at least one band/artist that they can't stand. Don't they? I have several, but, of course, I won't name them here so as not to offend potential users. Just add them to the "artistBlacklist" array in pandooruh_plus_plus.js.

That's it for now, but this projet is still in its infancy. As soon as the bugs get worked out, I'll be adding more features.
